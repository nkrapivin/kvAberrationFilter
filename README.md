# kvAberrationFilter
KeeVee's Aberration shader as an IDE filter!

# Installation

- Download this repo as a zip.
- Copy the `_filter_aberration` folder into `%PROGRAMDATA%\GameMakerStudio2-YOUR-CHANNEL\Cache\runtimes\runtime-YOUR-VERSION\bin\FiltersAndEffects\`

  where `YOUR-CHANNEL` might be `-Beta` if you use the Beta version, `-Dev` if you're a YoYo employee, or nothing at all if you use the release build.
  
  and `YOUR-VERSION` is your runtime version, might be something like `2.3.6.231` for release versions, something like `23.1.1.397` for Beta versions, and `9.2.1.2678` if you're a YoYo employee.

- Open your project, open any room, make a new effect layer, choose the new `Aberration` effect type.
- Observe the properties of said effect type, compare them to the original asset props.
- Have fun!

# Caveats,

(~~as with any thing really...~~)

- ~~Effects and filters in general only work for those who've activated a subscription~~ Not true anymore! If you still don't have filters&effects, Log out from the IDE completely and log back in, your license file should refresh. thx yoyo ðŸ’š
- When you install or switch to a different runtime, you have to copy the `_filter_aberration` folder there as well, a bit annoying, hope it gets "fixed" in the future. (otherwise it just errors out lol)
